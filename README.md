# packageexplorer

This repo contains the code for a shiny app to explore tidyverse function dependencies:  https://joycerobbins.shinyapps.io/packageexplorer/

The shiny app makes use of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) [pkginspector](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkginspector/) package to map and then visualize these dependencies.
